# GoGame
Go game implementation in c++

## Game rules
Rules of the game can be found here: [rules](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wjh/go/rules/Chinese.html)

I have used rules from the link above to implement game mechanics 

## TODO List:
- [ ] Add testing framework and create unit tests
- [ ] Change resizing system - board and wigets should be centered and not streached
