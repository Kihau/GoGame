# GoGame
Go game implementation in c++

## Game rules
I have used the following rules to implement inital version of game mechanics: [rules](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wjh/go/rules/Chinese.html)

More information about the game itself can be found here: [go-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))
## TODO List:
- [ ] Add testing framework and create unit tests
- [ ] Change resizing system - board and wigets should be centered and not streached
